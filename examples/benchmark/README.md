## Clickstream benchmark tool

We have developed a tool for benchmark tests, which utilizes ECS Fargate to continuously send mock data to Clickstream. The number of ECS Service tasks can be increased or decreased to adjust the RPS (Requests per Second).

### Prerequesisities
- Make sure you have an AWS account
- Configure [credential of aws cli][configure-aws-cli]
- Install Docker Engine

### Detail steps

Follow below step to start your Clickstream benchmark test
1. Add configuration file:

Please download your `amplifyconfiguration.json` file from your web console of the solution, then copy it to the root
folder which at the same level as README file. then you can execute the following command to create and send your sample
data.

In the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file, we will only parse `appId`, `endpoint` and `isCompressEvents` three parameters
to run the program.

2. Start benchmark test:
Run below script to start benchmark test
```
./create-ecs-benchmark-test.sh <testName> <taskNumber> <region>
```

<testName>: the suffix of the ECS cluster name, for example: if <testName> is **MyTest**, you ECS cluster name is **clickstream-sample-data-cluster-MyTest**
<taskNumber>: the number of your ECS service tasks, you can change it from the ECS console after the cluster created.
<region>: the region where the ECS cluster created.
For example: 
```
./create-ecs-benchmark-test.sh MyTest 5 us-east-1
```

According to our testing, if the ECS cluster of benchmark tool is created in the same region of the Clickstream solution, a task can generate about 200 RPS.
A request payload size is ~2KB and contains 10 events.

3. Clean up benchmark test resources.
run below script to clean up all resources of benchmark test tool
```
./cleanup-ecs-benchmark-test.sh <testName> <region>
```
